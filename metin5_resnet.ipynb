        "\n",
        "In this notebook we'll be implementing one of the [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) (Residual Network) model variants. Much like the [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) model introduced in the previous notebook, ResNet was designed for the [ImageNet challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/), which it won in 2015.\n",
        "\n",
        "ResNet, like VGG, also has multiple *configurations* which specify the number of layers and the sizes of those layers. Each layer is made out of *blocks*, which are made up of convolutional layers, batch normalization layers and *residual connections* (also called *skip connections* or *shortcut connections*). Confusingly, ResNets use the term \"layer\" to refer to both a set of blocks, e.g. \"layer 1 has two blocks\", and also the total number of layers within the entire ResNet, e.g. \"ResNet18 has 18 layers\".\n",
        "\n",
        "A residual connection is simply a direct connection between the input of a block and the output of a block. Sometimes the residual connection has layers in it, but most of the time it does not. Below is an example block with an identity residual connection, i.e. no layers in the residual path.\n",

        "From the table above, we can see that for ResNet18 and ResNet34 that the first block contains two 3x3 convolutional layers with 64 filters, and that ResNet18 has two of these blocks in the first layer, whilst Resnet34 has three. ResNet50, ResNet101 and ResNet152 blocks have a different structure than those in ResNet18 and ResNet34, and these blocks are called *bottleneck* blocks. Bottleneck blocks reduce the number of number of channels within the input before expanding them back out again. Below shows a standard *BasicBlock* (left) - used by ResNet18 and ResNet34 - and the *Bottleneck* block used by ResNet50, ResNet101 and ResNet152.\n",

        "\n",
        "Why do ResNets work? The key is in the residual connections. Training incredibly deep neural networks is difficult due to the gradient signal either exploding (becoming very large) or vanishing (becoming very small) as it gets backpropagated through many layers. Residual connections allow the model to learn how to \"skip\" layers - by setting all their weights to zero and only rely on the residual connection. Thus, in theory, if your ResNet152 model can actually learn the desired function between input and output by only using the first 52 layers the remaining 100 layers should set their weights to zero and the output of the 52nd layer will simply pass through the residual connections unhindered. This also allows for the gradient signal to also backpropagate through those 100 layers unhindered too. This outcome could also also be achieved in a network without residual connections, the \"skipped\" layers would learn to set their weights to one, however adding the residual connection is more explicit and is easier for the model to learn to use these residual connections.\n",

        "In this notebook we'll also be showing how to use torchvision to handle datasets that are not part of `torchvision.datasets`. Specificially we'll be using the 2011 version of the [CUB200](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html) dataset. This is a dataset with 200 different species of birds. Each species has around 60 images, which are around 500x500 pixels each. Our goal is to correctly determine which species an image belongs to - a 200-dimensional image classification problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "As this is a relatively small dataset - ~12,000 images compared to CIFAR10's 60,000 images - we'll be using a pre-trained model and then performing transfer learning using discriminative fine-tuning. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** on the CUB200 dataset website there is a warning about some of the images in the dataset also appearing in ImageNet, which our pre-trained model was trained on. If any of those images are in our test set then this would be a form of \"information leakage\" as we are evaluating our model on images it has been trained on. However, the GitHub gist linked at the end of [this](https://guopei.github.io/2016/Overlap-Between-Imagenet-And-CUB/) article states that only 43 of the images appear in ImageNet. Even if they all ended up in the test set this would only be ~1% of all images in there so would have a negligible impact on performance.\n",

Specifically, we'll use the *one cycle learning learning rate scheduler*, also known as *superconvergnence*, from [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820) paper and is commonly used in the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/).\n",

        "\n",
        "As we can see, there is a common 7x7 convolutional layer and max pooling layer at the start of all ResNet models - these layers also have padding, which is not shown in the table. These are followed by four \"layers\", each containing a different number of blocks. There are two different blocks used, one for the ResNet18 and ResNet34 - called the `BasicBlock` - , and one for the ResNet50, ResNet101 and ResNet152 - called the `Bottleneck` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our `ResNet` class defines the initial 7x7 convolutional layer along with batch normalization, a ReLU activation function and a downsampling max pooling layer. We then build the four layers from the provided configuration, `config`, which specifies: the block to use, the number of blocks in the layer, and the number of channels in that layer. For the `BasicBlock` the number of channels in a layer is simply the number of filters for both of the convolutional layers within the block. For the `Bottleneck` block, the number of channels refers to the number of filters used by the first two convolutional layers - the number of the filters in the final layer is the number of channels multiplied by an `expansion` factor, which is 4 for the `Bottleneck` block (and 1 for the `BasicBlock`). Also note that the `stride` of the first layer is one, whilst the `stride` of the last three layers is two. This `stride` is only used to change the `stride` of the first convolutional layer within a block and also in the \"downsampling\" residual path - we'll explain what downsampling in ResNets means shortly.\n",
        "\n",
        "`get_resnet_layer` is used to define the layers from the configuration by creating a `nn.Sequential` from a list of blocks. The first thing it checks is if the first block in a layer needs to have a downsampling residual path - only the first block within a layer ever needs to have a downsampling residual path. So, what is a downsampling residual path?\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification/blob/master/assets/resnet-skip.png?raw=1)\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that the key concept in the ResNet models is the residual (aka skip/identity) connection. However, if the number of channels within the image is changed in the main connection of the block then it won't have the same number of channels as the image from the residual connection and thus we cannot sum them together. Consider the first block in second layer of ResNet18, the image tensor passed to it will have 64 channels and the output will have 128 channels. Thus, we need to make a residual connection between a 64 channel tensor and a 128 channel tensor. ResNet models solve this using a downsampling connection - technically, it doesn't always downsample the image as sometimes the image height and width stay the same - which increases the number of channels in the image through the residual connection by passing them through a convolutional layer. \n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, to check if we need to downsample within a block or not, we simply check if the number of channels into the block - `in_channels` - is the number of channels out of the block - defined by the `channels` argument multipled by the `expansion` factor of the block. Only the first block in each layer is checked if it needs to downsample or not. After each layer is created, we update `in_channels` to be the number of channels of the image when it is output by the layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then follow the four layers with a 1x1 adaptive average pool. This will take the average over the entire height and width of the image separately for each channel. Thus, if the input to the average pool is `[512, 7, 7]` (512 channels and a height and width of seven) then the output of the average pool will be `[512, 1, 1]`. We then pass this average pooled output to a linear layer to make a prediction. We always know how many channels will be in the image after the fourth layer as we continuously update `in_channels` to be equal to the number of the channels in the image output by each layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "One thing to note is that the initial convolutional layer has `bias = False`, which means there is no bias term used by the filters. In fact, every convolutional layer used within every ResNet model always has `bias = False`. The authors of the ResNet paper argue that the bias terms are unnecessary as every convolutional layer in a ResNet is followed by a batch normalization layer which has a $\\beta$ (beta) term that does the same thing as the bias term in the convolutional layer, a simple addition. See the previous notebook for more details on how batch normalization works."
